HAJERI/gemma-3-4b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Diabetes mellitus & hypoglycemia,"A 62-year-old male with a long-standing history of type 2 diabetes presents with increasing confusion, irritability, and a noticeable tremor. He reports feeling cold despite a normal room temperature. His blood glucose has been poorly controlled, and he admits to skipping meals. His current medication regimen includes metformin and a thiazide diuretic.",Initiate immediate intravenous dextrose therapy.,Confirm the diagnosis of hypoglycemia and assess for autonomic neuropathy.,Increase his dose of sulfonylureas.,Order a fasting lipid panel.,B,"The clinical picture – confusion, irritability, tremor, cold intolerance, and skipping meals – strongly suggests hypoglycemia, particularly in the presence of autonomic neuropathy (as evidenced by tremor and sweating, though sweating is often absent in later stages). Confirming the diagnosis is crucial, and assessing for autonomic neuropathy helps determine the underlying mechanism and guides treatment. Option A is too aggressive initially; Option C would likely worsen the hypoglycemia. Option D is not directly relevant to the immediate concern."
HAJERI/gemma-3-4b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Thyroid disorders,"A 68-year-old male with a history of untreated Graves' disease presents with worsening fatigue, weight loss, and cold intolerance. His current medications include levothyroxine 15 mcg daily. His most recent TSH is 0.05 mIU/mL, and his free T4 is 2.8 ng/dL.",Immediately discontinue levothyroxine and initiate a full thyroidectomy.,Reduce the levothyroxine dose and monitor TSH and free T4 levels closely.,Increase the levothyroxine dose and re-evaluate in 4-6 weeks.,"Order an antibody panel (TRAb, TPOAb, TgAb) to assess for autonomous thyroiditis.",B,"The patient is clinically euthyroid (TSH 0.05, FT4 2.8) but is receiving levothyroxine, likely over-treated due to his prior hyperthyroidism. Reducing the dose and careful monitoring is the most appropriate initial approach to achieve euthyroidism and avoid hypothyroidism."
HAJERI/gemma-3-4b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Adrenal disorders,"A 60-year-old male with a history of long-standing, poorly controlled hypertension and central obesity presents with significant fatigue, muscle weakness, and recent weight loss despite increased appetite. Initial laboratory tests reveal elevated serum cortisol, suppressed 24-hour urinary free cortisol, and elevated serum ACTH.",Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease),Secondary adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary failure,Cushing syndrome,Pheochromocytoma,B,"The elevated ACTH level indicates that the pituitary gland is stimulating the adrenal glands, but the adrenal glands are not responding adequately, leading to suppressed cortisol and secondary adrenal insufficiency. The clinical picture of fatigue, weakness, and weight loss with hypertension and central obesity is classic for this pattern."
HAJERI/gemma-3-4b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Pituitary & hypothalamic disorders,"A 38-year-old male with progressive fatigue, weight loss, and amenorrhea is found to have markedly low levels of morning serum cortisol. Pituitary MRI reveals a mac-sized pituitary adenoma.",Initiate immediate surgical resection of the adenoma.,Begin treatment with high-dose hydrocortisone and observe.,Prescribe levothyroxine to address the hypothyroidism.,Order a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tap to rule out carcinomatous meningitis.,B,"Patients with pituitary adenomas causing cortisol deficiency (adrenocorticolopexy) typically require replacement hydrocortisone. While surgical resection is the ultimate goal, initial stabilization with glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoid replacement is crucial. Option C is incorrect; hypothyroidism is a common consequence of pituitary dysfunction but is addressed *after* adequate cortisol replacement. Option D is not indicated as the primary initial step."
HAJERI/gemma-3-4b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,"Calcium, parathyroid & metabolic bone disease","A 68-year-old woman with a history of poorly controlled chronic hyperthyroidism presents with new-onset fatigue, constipation, and bone pain. Her serum calcium is elevated to 11.8 mg/dL, and her parathyroid hormone (PTH) is suppressed. An initial DXA scan reveals osteopenia.",Initiate immediate treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates and calcium supplementation.,Suspect primary hyperparathyroidism and investigate with an sestu-MI scan.,Rule out vitamin D deficiency and consider thiazide diuretics.,Order a 24-hour urine collection for calcium and magnesium.,B,Elevated calcium and suppressed PTH strongly suggest primary hyperparathyroidism. The history of hyperthyroidism (which can sometimes cause PTH resistance) further supports this suspicion. A sestu-MI scan is crucial to localize the parathyroid glands. Bisphosphonates are premature without confirming the etiology.
HAJERI/gemma-3-4b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Female reproductive endocrinology,"A 32-year-old woman with amenorrhea for the past 12 months is found to have elevated serum FSH and LH levels, and low serum estradiol. She is premenopausal and reports no significant stress or weight loss.",Likely primary ovarian insufficiency (POI).,Suggestive of premature ovarian aging.,Most likely secondary ovarian failure due to pituitary dysfunction.,A normal finding in women experiencing mild anxiety.,A,"Elevated FSH and LH, with low estradiol, are classic findings of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), indicating the ovaries are failing to respond adequately. Premature ovarian aging is a related, but the initial pattern points to ovarian failure. Secondary ovarian failure would be associated with low testosterone and prolactin. Anxiety can cause mild, transient changes, not typically this robust pattern."
HAJERI/gemma-3-4b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Male reproductive endocrinology,"A 32-year-old male presents with progressive erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and fatigue over the past 6 months. His serum testosterone is low (135 ng/dL). His pituitary MRI is normal.",Initiate immediate testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) with injectable testosterone.,Order a serum free testosterone level and a testosterone binding globulin (TBG) level.,Prescribe sildenafil and advise lifestyle modifications.,Order an FSH and LH level to rule out ovarian failure.,B,"A low total testosterone level can be misleading in men, as it can be influenced by the proportion of free testosterone (bound to SHBG) and TBG. Evaluating free testosterone and TBG is crucial to determine if the testosterone is biologically active and to identify potential causes of low testosterone (e.g., decreased SHBG)."
HAJERI/gemma-3-4b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,"Obesity, lipids & nutrition","A 48-year-old male with a BMI of 32 kg/m² and a family history of early cardiovascular disease presents with increasing waist circumference, elevated triglycerides, and borderline elevated LDL cholesterol. He reports a diet high in processed foods and infrequent exercise.","Initiate immediate aggressive statin therapy and a low-fat, low-carbohydrate diet.","Counsel on lifestyle modifications including weight loss, increased physical activity, and dietary changes, followed by lipid panel re-evaluation.",Prescribe metformin to improve insulin sensitivity and address potential metabolic syndrome.,Order a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score to assess for underlying atherosclerosis.,B,"Lifestyle modifications are the cornerstone of initial management for obesity, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. Counseling, weight loss, exercise, and dietary changes are crucial before initiating pharmacologic interventions. A repeat lipid panel after these changes will assess response."
HAJERI/gemma-3-4b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Endocrine neoplasia & hereditary syndromes,A 12-year-old child is diagnosed with Wilms' tumor. Initial evaluation reveals a markedly elevated serum metanephrine level and a normal plasma metanephrine-to-normetanephrine ratio.,This finding strongly suggests a benign pheochromocytoma.,"This finding is characteristic of familial paraganglioma (e.g., MEN2A) and suggests a potential for a pheochromocytoma.",This finding definitively rules out any possibility of a catecholamine-producing tumor.,This finding indicates an autonomously functioning cortisol-producing tumor.,B,"The elevated metanephrine level, *despite* a normal metanephrine-to-normetanephrine ratio, is a key feature of familial paraganglioma, particularly MEN2A. This ratio helps differentiate between benign and catecholamine-producing tumors.  A high metanephrine level suggests increased sympathetic nervous system chromaffin cell activity."
HAJERI/gemma-3-4b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Pediatric endocrinology & growth/puberty,"A 9-year-old child presents with markedly elevated urine specific gravity, excessive thirst, and reports feeling very tired. Initial laboratory tests reveal a random plasma glucose of 160 mg/dL and a urine glucose level of 300 mg. The child is also experiencing significant irritability and difficulty concentrating.",Initiate immediate insulin therapy and initiate a strict low-carbohydrate diet.,"Suspect and investigate early onset type 1 diabetes mellitus, and assess for acanthosis nigricans.",Confirm the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and prescribe oral metformin.,Order a comprehensive thyroid panel to rule out underlying hypothyroidism.,B,"The combination of polyuria, polydipsia, elevated glucose, and fatigue strongly suggests diabetes mellitus. In children, early-onset type 1 diabetes is a significant concern, particularly given the reported irritability and concentration difficulties. Acanthosis nigricans (skin darkening in body folds) is a characteristic sign of insulin resistance and supports the suspicion of type 1 or type 2 diabetes."
HAJERI/gemma-3-1b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Diabetes mellitus & hypoglycemia,"A 62-year-old female patient presents to the clinic reporting persistent fatigue, weakness, and increased thirst.

Which of the following is the MOST likely underlying cause?",Addison’s disease,Hyperthyroidism,Hypothyroidism,Cushing’s syndrome,B,"Hyperthyroidism is the most likely cause of persistent fatigue, palpitations, shortness of breath, and elevated blood pressure due to the thyroid’s overactive stimulation of the adrenal glands."
HAJERI/gemma-3-1b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Pituitary & hypothalamic disorders,"A 32-year-old female patient presents with fatigue, weight gain, and irregular menstrual periods. She reports feeling unusually tired and experiencing a decrease in libido. Which of the following is the MOST likely underlying cause?",Hyperthyroidism,Hypothyroidism,Pituitary Dysfunction,Adrenal Hyperstimulation,C,"...The combination of fatigue, weight gain, irregular periods, and decreased libido strongly suggests a pituitary dysfunction due to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis disruption, which can lead to decreased production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and subsequent hormonal imbalances."
HAJERI/gemma-3-1b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,"Calcium, parathyroid & metabolic bone disease","A 68-year-old female patient presents with fatigue, weight gain, and elevated serum calcium levels (12.5 mg/dL). She reports a history of osteoporosis and a family history of familial hypercalcemia. What is the most likely underlying cause?",Hypoparathyroid syndrome,Hyperparathyroidism,Metabolic bone disease with calcium imbalances,Hyperparathyroidism with secondary hyperparathyroidism,C,"Metabolic bone disease with calcium imbalances, particularly in the context of osteoporosis and a family history of familial hypercalcemia, strongly suggests metabolic bone disease, which is the most likely cause of calcium elevation and related symptoms."

The first-line treatment for conscious hypoglycemic patients is rapid-acting oral glucose. If unable to swallow or level of consciousness is declining, IV dextrose is needed, but this patient is currently responsive enough for oral treatment. Glucagon is for when IV access is unavailable or the patient is unconscious. Insulin would worsen hypoglycemia."
HAJERI/gemma-3-27b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Thyroid disorders,"A 32-year-old woman presents with a diffusely enlarged, non-tender thyroid gland. She reports a history of post-partum amenorrhea 6 months ago and feels fatigued. Her TSH is 8.5 mIU/L (normal 0.4-4.0 mIU/L) and free T4 is 0.8 ng/dL (normal 0.8-1.8 ng/dL). Anti-TPO antibodies are elevated.",Hashimoto's thyroiditis (postpartum) is the most likely diagnosis.,Subacute thyroiditis is the most likely diagnosis.,Pituitary adenoma causing secondary hypothyroidism should be ruled out.,Iodine excess is the most likely cause.,A,"The clinical picture (postpartum, goiter, fatigue, elevated TSH, low T4, positive anti-TPO) is classic for postpartum Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which often presents with transient hypothyroidism progressing to permanent hypothyroidism."

What is the most likely underlying endocrine disorder?",Cushing's syndrome,Primary hyperaldosteronism,Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency),Pheochromocytoma,C,"The clinical picture (fatigue, weight loss, hyperpigmentation, hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, low cortisol) is highly suggestive of Addison's disease. Autoimmune thyroid disease increases the risk of other autoimmune endocrine disorders."
HAJERI/gemma-3-27b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Pituitary & hypothalamic disorders,"A 30-year-old woman presents 6 weeks postpartum. She reports a persistent milky discharge from her nipples despite not breastfeeding, and she has not had a period since delivery. Her prolactin level is markedly elevated. An MRI of the pituitary is ordered.
What is the MOST likely finding on the MRI if the cause is a pituitary adenoma?","A large, homogeneously enhancing pituitary mass with displacement of the pituitary stalk.","A small (<1 cm) pituitary mass, often eccentric, with a normal pituitary stalk.",Pituitary atrophy and a thickened pituitary stalk.,"Normal pituitary morphology, but evidence of hypothalamic inflammation.",A,"Prolactinomas are the most common pituitary adenomas. They typically present as a larger, often eccentric, pituitary mass that expands the sella turcica and can compress the pituitary stalk, though stalk compression isn't always present. While smaller prolactinomas exist, a markedly elevated prolactin postpartum suggests a more substantial adenoma."
HAJERI/gemma-3-27b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,"Calcium, parathyroid & metabolic bone disease","A 68-year-old woman with a history of chronic kidney disease (eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73m²) presents for routine follow-up. Her calcium is 8.2 mg/dL (normal 8.5-10.5), PTH is 850 pg/mL (normal 15-65), and vitamin D is 28 ng/mL (sufficient). She denies bone pain.
What is the MOST likely explanation for these findings?",Primary hyperparathyroidism,Vitamin D deficiency causing secondary hyperparathyroidism,Secondary hyperparathyroidism due to chronic kidney disease,Hypoparathyroidism,C,"Chronic kidney disease leads to decreased vitamin D activation and phosphate retention. This causes hypocalcemia and stimulates PTH secretion. While her Vitamin D is sufficient now, the underlying CKD is the primary driver of elevated PTH. Primary hyperparathyroidism would present with *hyper*calcemia."
HAJERI/gemma-3-27b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Female reproductive endocrinology,"A 32-year-old woman presents with secondary amenorrhea (no menses for 6 months) and reports consistently negative pregnancy tests. She denies significant stress, has a normal prolactin level, and reports adequate caloric intake. On examination, she has scant pubic and axillary hair. Her BMI is 19.",Hypothalamic amenorrhea due to functional hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.,Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI).,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).,Asherman syndrome.,A,"Scant pubic/axillary hair with amenorrhea and normal weight/prolactin suggests a problem with GnRH pulsatility, consistent with functional hypogonadotropic hypogonadism often seen in hypothalamic amenorrhea. While POI is possible, the physical exam findings are less typical. PCOS usually presents with hirsutism/acne and often obesity. Asherman syndrome causes amenorrhea but doesn’t explain the hair findings."
HAJERI/gemma-3-27b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Male reproductive endocrinology,"A 42-year-old man presents with fatigue, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. His serum testosterone is 220 ng/dL on two separate morning measurements. Prolactin is normal. He has no history of pituitary disease or androgen use.",Immediately initiate testosterone replacement therapy.,Repeat testosterone measurements with added free testosterone and SHBG levels to assess for true hypogonadism.,Order a semen analysis to assess for primary testicular failure.,Refer directly to a urologist for evaluation of erectile dysfunction.,B,"A testosterone of 220 ng/dL is low, but requires further characterization. Total testosterone can be misleading due to variations in Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG). Free testosterone and SHBG levels will help determine if the low total testosterone represents true biologically inactive hypogonadism."
HAJERI/gemma-3-27b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,"Obesity, lipids & nutrition","A 48-year-old male with a BMI of 32 kg/m² and a waist circumference of 108 cm presents for a routine checkup. His fasting glucose is 105 mg/dL, HDL is 38 mg/dL, and triglycerides are 180 mg/dL. He denies any symptoms.
According to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) criteria (metabolic syndrome), how many criteria are met?",1,2,3,4,C,"The patient meets three criteria: Waist circumference >40 inches (108cm), Fasting glucose 100-125 mg/dL, and HDL <40 mg/dL. Elevated triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL) would be a fourth criterion, but his are 180mg/dL. BMI is not a direct ATP III criterion for metabolic syndrome *diagnosis* though it indicates obesity."

She reports new-onset galactorrhea and irregular menses.","MEN1 should be strongly suspected, and serum calcium, prolactin, and IGF-1 should be checked.","MEN2A is the most likely diagnosis, requiring RET mutation analysis and calcitonin levels.","Carney complex is suspected, requiring GNAS1 mutation testing and echocardiography.","Isolated familial hyperprolactinemia is the most probable diagnosis, and a brain MRI is sufficient.",A,"The constellation of pituitary adenoma (causing galactorrhea/menstrual irregularities), renal cysts, and pancreatic NETs is highly characteristic of MEN1. Calcium is checked to assess for parathyroid adenomas, prolactin for pituitary tumors, and IGF-1 to screen for acromegaly."
HAJERI/gemma-3-27b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Pediatric endocrinology & growth/puberty,"A 14-year-old girl presents with primary amenorrhea (no menses by age 15) and has normal female karyotype (46,XX). She has normal ovarian function (confirmed by labs) but reports consistently intense exercise (long-distance running 5 days/week) and a restrictive diet focused on maintaining a very low body weight.",Constitutional delay of puberty is the most likely diagnosis.,She likely has Kallmann syndrome requiring GnRH therapy.,Hypothalamic amenorrhea due to functional hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is the most likely diagnosis.,She likely has primary ovarian failure requiring estrogen replacement.,C,"The scenario points to functional hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Intense exercise and restrictive dieting can lead to low energy availability, suppressing GnRH pulse generator function and resulting in amenorrhea *despite* normal ovarian function. This is hypothalamic amenorrhea."

HAJERI/gemma-3-12b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Diabetes mellitus & hypoglycemia,A 68-year-old patient with a long history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes presents to the emergency department with altered mental status and a blood glucose of 45 mg/dL. The patient is currently on oral hypoglycemic agents but reports missing several doses of medication.,Administer intravenous dextrose 50% and monitor glucose closely.,Administer glucagon intramuscularly and observe.,Administer intravenous normal saline and check for ketones.,Administer a rapid-acting oral glucose and recheck blood glucose in 15 minutes.,A,"This patient is experiencing severe hypoglycemia requiring immediate intervention. Given the altered mental status, intravenous dextrose is the fastest and most reliable way to raise blood glucose and prevent further neurological compromise. Glucagon is an option if the patient is unable to take oral glucose, but IV dextrose is preferred in this scenario."
HAJERI/gemma-3-12b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Thyroid disorders,"A 68-year-old woman with a long-standing history of Graves' disease, currently in stable remission on levothyroxine, presents with new-onset atrial fibrillation. Her TSH is 0.3 mIU/L (normal range 0.4-4.0 mIU/L), and free T4 is 1.0 ng/dL (normal range 0.8-1.2 ng/dL). She is asymptomatic otherwise. Her cardiologist recommends initiating an anticoagulant. What is the most appropriate endocrine management?",Immediately discontinue levothyroxine and re-evaluate thyroid function in 6 weeks.,Increase levothyroxine dose to further suppress TSH.,"Continue current levothyroxine dose and manage atrial fibrillation with anticoagulation, monitoring thyroid function periodically.",Add propranolol to control heart rate and monitor thyroid function closely without altering levothyroxine.,C,"The patient is in stable remission with TSH slightly low but free T4 within normal limits. The atrial fibrillation is likely an independent cardiac event, not a sign of overt hyperthyroidism. Discontinuing levothyroxine would induce hypothyroidism. Increasing levothyroxine would worsen the subclinical hyperthyroidism risk. Propranolol addresses the arrhythmia but doesn't correct the underlying thyroid status. The best approach is to maintain current levothyroxine and focus on anticoagulation for the atrial fibrillation, with routine thyroid monitoring."
HAJERI/gemma-3-12b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Adrenal disorders,"A 40-year-old woman with a history of bilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing's disease presents with nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and abdominal pain. Her cortisol is undetectable. She has not been consistently taking hydrocortisone.

MRI reveals a 2 cm pituitary adenoma. Her prolactin level is 85 ng/mL. She desires fertility. What is the MOST appropriate initial management strategy?","Start cabergoline immediately, aiming for prolactin suppression and monitoring for visual field improvement.","Surgical resection of the adenoma, prioritizing visual field restoration.","Observation with serial prolactin measurements and visual field testing, without initial medical therapy.","Initiate dopamine agonist therapy (e.g., cabergoline) but defer surgery until medical management fails or significant visual field compromise occurs.",D,"Dopamine agonists (like cabergoline) are typically the first-line treatment for prolactinomas, especially in women desiring fertility. Surgery is reserved for cases of persistent hyperprolactinemia despite medical therapy, significant visual field compromise that doesn't improve with medication, or large adenomas causing mass effect."
HAJERI/gemma-3-12b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,"Calcium, parathyroid & metabolic bone disease","A 62-year-old woman with a history of osteoporosis presents with new-onset muscle weakness, constipation, and a calcium level of 11.8 mg/dL (normal albumin). Her PTH is 65 pg/mL (normal range 10-60 pg/mL). Vitamin D level is 18 ng/mL. She denies any recent trauma. Bone density testing 2 years ago showed stable T-scores. What is the most likely explanation for her presentation?","Primary hyperparathyroidism, early and mild, masked by vitamin D deficiency.","Secondary hyperparathyroidism due to chronic, mild vitamin D deficiency causing transient hypercalcemia.",Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH).,Lithium-induced hypercalcemia.,B,"The patient has mild hypercalcemia and a PTH in the upper limit of normal. Her low vitamin D is a strong predisposing factor for secondary hyperparathyroidism, which can cause transient hypercalcemia and the described symptoms. The stable bone density rules out aggressive primary hyperparathyroidism. FHH typically presents with lower PTH and calcium levels. Lithium is not mentioned in the history."
HAJERI/gemma-3-12b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Female reproductive endocrinology,A 32-year-old woman with a history of irregular periods and hirsutism is found to have a significantly elevated serum testosterone level. She denies any virilizing symptoms beyond mild hirsutism. Ultrasound of the ovaries is normal. Further investigation is needed to determine the source of the testosterone. What is the most appropriate next step?,Measure DHEA-S levels.,Perform an overnight dexamethasone suppression test.,Measure SHBG levels.,Repeat the testosterone measurement with a different laboratory.,B,"In a woman with elevated testosterone and normal ovaries, excluding adrenal androgen production is crucial. The overnight dexamethasone suppression test assesses for ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, which can cause adrenal androgen hypersecretion. DHEA-S would be elevated if adrenal androgen production is the cause, but the dexamethasone test is a more direct assessment of ACTH dependence. SHBG reflects peripheral androgen activity, and repeating the test is less informative initially."
HAJERI/gemma-3-12b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Male reproductive endocrinology,"A 45-year-old man with a history of cryptorchidism presents for evaluation of infertility. His serum FSH is significantly elevated, and his testosterone is low. Ultrasound reveals bilateral micronodular testicular hyperplasia. What is the most likely underlying etiology?",Klinefelter syndrome,Primary testicular failure due to Sertoli cell-only dysfunction,Kallmann syndrome,Aging (androgen decline in the elderly),B,"The combination of elevated FSH, low testosterone, cryptorchidism, and micronodular testicular hyperplasia strongly suggests primary testicular failure due to Sertoli cell-only dysfunction. Sertoli cells are responsible for FSH responsiveness and sperm production; their absence leads to elevated FSH and impaired testosterone production despite the gonadotropin stimulation. Micronodular testicular hyperplasia is a characteristic finding in this condition. Klinefelter syndrome typically presents with low testosterone, high FSH, and a 47,XXY karyotype (not mentioned). Kallmann syndrome involves anosmia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Androgen decline in the elderly is a more gradual process."

Which of the following screening tests is MOST crucial to add to their routine surveillance?,Annual monitoring of serum prolactin.,Annual monitoring of serum growth hormone and IGF-1.,Annual endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs).,Annual bone density scan.,C,"MEN1 is associated with a high risk of PNETs, often in the pancreas. EUS is the preferred surveillance method for detecting these tumors. Prolactin, growth hormone/IGF-1, and bone density are important considerations in MEN1, but PNET screening is the highest priority given the existing duodenal NET and parathyroid disease."

What is the MOST likely underlying diagnosis?",Constitutional Delay of Growth and Puberty,Prader-Willi Syndrome,Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism,Klinefelter Syndrome,C,"The combination of significantly delayed puberty, poor growth (height at 3rd percentile), and a markedly delayed bone age (4 years) strongly suggests a hormonal deficiency causing both impaired growth and delayed puberty. While constitutional delay can have delayed puberty, the significant growth failure and substantial bone age delay are more characteristic of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Prader-Willi has distinct features (hyperphagia later). Klinefelter syndrome has an abnormal karyotype (which is normal here)."

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Graves' disease,Hashimoto's thyroiditis,Thyroiditis,Thyroid cancer,B,"The low TSH and elevated free T4 in this patient suggest Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which is the most common form of autoimmune thyroiditis.
interpretation
The text states, 'In Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the thyroid gland is infiltrated by lymphocytes, which release antibodies that destroy the thyroid tissue.' This leads to low TSH and elevated free T4.

etiology
The text also mentions, 'In Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the thyroid gland is infiltrated by lymphocytes, which release antibodies that destroy the thyroid tissue.' This leads to low TSH and elevated free T4.

clinical manifestations
The text further describes the clinical manifestations of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, including fatigue, weight loss, and goiter. These symptoms are typical of hypothyroidism.

diagnosis
The diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is made based on the low TSH and elevated free T4.

management
Treatment for Hashimoto's thyroiditis includes antithyroid drugs (e.g., methimazole or propylthiouracil) to suppress the thyroid gland and improve symptoms.

outcome
The outcome of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is usually a remission of symptoms and improvement in thyroid function tests over time.

general considerations
Autoimmune thyroiditis is a common cause of hypothyroidism, particularly in women of childbearing age. It is managed with antithyroid drugs and lifestyle changes."

interpretation
The elevated sodium and potassium levels are consistent with secondary hyperaldosteronism, which is caused by an adrenal adenoma secreting excess aldosterone.

etiology
The elevated sodium and potassium levels are consistent with secondary hyperaldosteronism, which is caused by an adrenal adenoma secreting excess aldosterone.

clinical manifestations
The elevated sodium and potassium levels are consistent with secondary hyperaldosteronism, which is caused by an adrenal adenoma secreting excess aldosterone.

diagnosis
The elevated sodium and potassium levels are consistent with secondary hyperaldosteronism, which is caused by an adrenal adenoma secreting excess aldosterone.

management
The management of secondary hyperaldosteronism includes reducing the secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal adenoma. This can be done with medications like spironolactone or eplerenone.

patient education
Patients with secondary hyperaldosteronism should be advised to avoid salt-rich foods and to take medications to control their blood pressure.

outcomes
The management of secondary hyperaldosteronism aims to reduce the secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal adenoma, which can lead to improved blood pressure control and reduced fluid retention.

general endocrinology
Adrenal adenomas are a common cause of secondary hyperaldosteronism, which can lead to hypertension, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia."

B: - Correct: Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism and is characterized by suppressed TSH, elevated free T4, and a diffuse goiter. It is often associated with eye symptoms.
C: - Incorrect: Toxic multinodular goiter can cause hyperthyroidism but usually presents with multiple nodules rather than a diffuse goiter.
D: - Incorrect: Thyroid cancer does not typically cause hyperthyroidism or a diffuse goiter."
HAJERI/gpt-oss-20b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Adrenal disorders,"A 45-year-old woman presents with weight gain, facial rounding, and purple striae. Her 24-hour urinary free cortisol is elevated, and an overnight dexamethasone suppression test shows inadequate cortisol suppression.",Pituitary MRI,Adrenal CT scan,Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test,Serum ACTH level,A,"A: - Correct: Pituitary MRI is the next step to evaluate for a pituitary adenoma (Cushing's disease) when there is evidence of endogenous Cushing's syndrome and inadequate cortisol suppression on the dexamethasone test.
B: - Incorrect: Adrenal CT scan is used to evaluate adrenal glands for hyperplasia or adenomas, but pituitary MRI is the first step in this scenario.
C: - Incorrect: The low-dose dexamethasone suppression test is used to screen for Cushing's syndrome, but it is not the next step after confirming elevated cortisol and inadequate suppression.
D: - Incorrect: Serum ACTH level is used to differentiate between ACTH-dependent and ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome, but pituitary MRI is the next step in this case."
HAJERI/gpt-oss-20b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Pituitary & hypothalamic disorders,"A 45-year-old woman presents with progressive visual field loss, headaches, and bitemporal hemianopsia. MRI reveals a pituitary macroadenoma compressing the optic chiasm. She also reports fatigue, weight loss, and cold intolerance.",Transsphenoidal surgery,Transsphenoidal surgery followed by radiotherapy,High-dose glucocorticoid therapy,High-dose levothyroxine therapy,A,"A: - Correct: Transsphenoidal surgery is the first-line treatment for pituitary macroadenomas causing mass effect symptoms like visual field loss. It also addresses potential hypopituitarism.
B: - Incorrect: Radiotherapy is considered if the tumor is not fully resected or if it recurs, but it is not the initial treatment for a symptomatic macroadenoma.
C: - Incorrect: High-dose glucocorticoids are used for adrenal crisis or Cushing's disease, not for hypothyroidism or pituitary adenomas causing mass effect.
D: - Incorrect: High-dose levothyroxine is used for hypothyroidism, but it does not address the mass effect of a pituitary adenoma."
HAJERI/gpt-oss-20b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,"Calcium, parathyroid & metabolic bone disease","A 60-year-old woman with a history of osteoporosis presents with fatigue, bone pain, and constipation.

HAJERI/gpt-oss-20b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Female reproductive endocrinology,"A 32-year-old woman presents with primary amenorrhea. She has normal breast development and axillary hair, but no pubic hair. Pelvic ultrasound is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Turner syndrome,Androgen insensitivity syndrome,Mullerian agenesis,Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism,B,"A: - Incorrect: Turner syndrome typically presents with primary amenorrhea, short stature, and streak gonads, with absent or scant pubic and axillary hair due to gonadal failure.
B: - Correct: Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is characterized by a 46,XY karyotype with testes that produce testosterone, but the body is resistant to androgens. This leads to female external genitalia, normal breast development (due to aromatization of testosterone to estrogen), scant or absent pubic/axillary hair (due to lack of androgen action), and primary amenorrhea (due to absent Mullerian structures). The uterus is typically absent on ultrasound.
C: - Incorrect: Mullerian agenesis (MRKH syndrome) presents with primary amenorrhea, normal breast and axillary hair, and normal ovaries, but a uterus and upper vagina are absent. The karyotype is 46,XX. Pelvic ultrasound would show an absent uterus.
D: - Incorrect: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism would present with primary or secondary amenorrhea, but pubic and axillary hair development would be normal or increased, and breast development would be delayed or absent in women."
HAJERI/gpt-oss-20b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-lora,Male reproductive endocrinology,"A 45-year-old man presents with decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and a history of infertility.

She has a normal bone age and is in Tanner stage 2 for breast development. Her parents are concerned about her growth pattern.,Start growth hormone therapy,Reassure and monitor growth and development,Order a thyroid function test,Refer for genetic evaluation of short stature,B,"The child is in the early stages of puberty (Tanner 2) and has a bone age that is likely appropriate for her chronological age. Her growth pattern, while at the 10th percentile, is within the normal range for children in early puberty. Reassurance and regular monitoring of growth and development are the most appropriate next steps. Growth hormone therapy is not indicated at this time, and thyroid function tests or genetic evaluation are not necessary unless there are other concerning features."
HAJERI/gpt-oss-20b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-merged-fp16,Diabetes mellitus & hypoglycemia,"Diabetes mellitus & hypoglycemia: A 55-year-old man with type 2 diabetes presents to the emergency department with confusion, sweating, and shaking.

What is the most appropriate initial treatment?",Intravenous dextrose,Oral glucose tablets,Glucagon injection,Insulin administration,B,"A: Incorrect: IV dextrose is used for severe hypoglycemia when the patient is unconscious or unable to swallow safely.B: Correct: Oral glucose is the first-line treatment for conscious patients with mild hypoglycemia, allowing them to raise their blood sugar quickly.C: Incorrect: Glucagon is used in cases of severe hypoglycemia where the patient cannot ingest oral glucose due to altered consciousness.D: Incorrect: Insulin should be avoided in hypoglycemic patients; it would worsen the condition."
HAJERI/gpt-oss-20b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-merged-fp16,Thyroid disorders,Thyroid disorders: A 60-year-old woman presents for routine follow-up of her differentiated thyroid cancer status. She underwent total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine ablation one year ago. Her TSH is suppressed on levothyroxine therapy. Serum thyroglobulin is elevated at 200 ng/mL (reference <1 ng/mL). Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are present but stable over time. What is the most appropriate next step in her evaluation?,Repeat serum thyroglobulin measurement in 3 months,Whole-body I-131 scan,Neck ultrasound,PET/CT scan,C,"A: Incorrect: While monitoring thyroglobulin trends is important, an elevated level post-total thyroidectomy warrants imaging to localize potential residual or metastatic disease rather than simply repeating the test.B: Incorrect: A whole-body I-131 scan is useful when there is suspicion of persistent or recurrent disease, but neck ultrasound can often identify smaller nodules or lymph node metastases that may not be visible on a whole-body scan.C: Correct: The presence of elevated thyroglobulin suggests residual or recurrent differentiated thyroid cancer. A neck ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality to evaluate for cervical lymph node metastasis.D: Incorrect: PET/CT scan is typically reserved for cases where thyroglobulin remains elevated despite negative radioactive iodine scans."
HAJERI/gpt-oss-20b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-merged-fp16,Adrenal disorders,"Adrenal disorders: A 50-year-old woman presents with weight gain, facial rounding, purple striae on her abdomen, and easy bruising.

What is the most appropriate next step in evaluating this patient?",Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test,MRI of the pituitary gland,Chest CT scan,Serum aldosterone level measurement,A,"A: Correct: The low-dose dexamethasone suppression test helps confirm endogenous Cushing's syndrome by assessing cortisol suppression after dexamethasone administration.B: Incorrect: MRI is useful for diagnosing Cushing's disease but should be performed only if there is evidence of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome.C: Incorrect: Chest CT is used to evaluate ectopic sources of ACTH production but is not first-line.D: Incorrect: Measuring serum aldosterone is relevant for primary hyperaldosteronism, not Cushing's syndrome."
HAJERI/gpt-oss-20b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-merged-fp16,Pituitary & hypothalamic disorders,"Pituitary & hypothalamic disorders: A 50-year-old woman presents with headaches, visual disturbances, and amenorrhea. MRI reveals a pituitary mass. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Prolactinoma,Craniopharyngioma,Pituitary adenoma,Meningioma,C,"A: Incorrect: Prolactinomas typically present with hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea, which are not described here.B: Correct: Craniopharyngiomas can cause symptoms of hypopituitarism and visual field defects due to their proximity to the optic chiasm.C: Correct: Pituitary adenomas are common causes of pituitary masses and can lead to similar symptoms depending on hormone secretion or compression effects.D: Incorrect: Meningiomas arise from meninges and usually do not present with endocrine abnormalities like amenorrhea."
HAJERI/gpt-oss-20b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-merged-fp16,"Calcium, parathyroid & metabolic bone disease","Calcium, parathyroid & metabolic bone disease: An elderly woman presents with generalized weakness, constipation, and confusion. Her serum calcium is elevated at 14 mg/dL, and her PTH level is suppressed. What is the most likely cause of her hypercalcemia?",Primary hyperparathyroidism,Malignancy-associated hypercalcemia,Vitamin D toxicity,Sarcoidosis,B,"A: Incorrect: In primary hyperparathyroidism, both calcium and PTH levels are typically elevated. Low PTH suggests an extrarenal cause.B: Correct: Malignancy-associated hypercalcemia often results from tumor secretion of PTHrP, leading to increased calcium and suppressed PTH. Symptoms align with severe hypercalcemia.C: Incorrect: Vitamin D toxicity leads to hypercalcemia but would usually present with elevated PTH levels rather than suppression.D: Incorrect: Sarcoidosis can cause hypercalcemia through increased vitamin D production, but typically does not suppress PTH in this manner."
HAJERI/gpt-oss-20b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-merged-fp16,Female reproductive endocrinology,"Female reproductive endocrinology: A 28-year-old woman presents for evaluation of primary amenorrhea. She has normal breast development but absent axillary hair. Karyotype is 46,XN. Serum FSH and LH are elevated. Her TSH is within normal limits. What is the most likely underlying defect in this patient?",Gonadal dysgenesis,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,Aromatase deficiency,Androgen insensitivity syndrome,D,"A: Incorrect: Gonadal dysgenesis would present with low estrogen leading to lack of breast development.B: Incorrect: CAH leads to excess androgen production causing virilization, often with menstrual irregularities rather than complete primary amenorrhea without axillary hair.C: Incorrect: Aromatase deficiency results in hirsutism due to unopposed androgens; axillary hair would be present.D: Correct: Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (XY karyotype) involves resistance to androgens. They develop female external genitalia/breasts (peripheral aromatization) but lack internal female structures. Minimal axillary hair is due to lack of androgen action. High testosterone and LH/FSH result from lack of negative feedback."
HAJERI/gpt-oss-20b-endocrinology-scenario-mcq-it-merged-fp16,Male reproductive endocrinology,"Male reproductive endocrinology: A 28-year-old man presents for evaluation of infertility. He has no significant medical history and reports normal sexual function. Physical examination reveals bilateral testes measuring 12 mL volume each, consistent with puberty. Serum FSH is elevated at 15 IU/L. LH is also elevated at 20 IU/L. Total testosterone is low at 200 ng/dL. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Primary testicular failure,Secondary hypogonadism due to pituitary dysfunction,Klinefelter syndrome,Constitutional delay in puberty,A,"A: Correct: Elevated FSH and LH levels indicate primary testicular failure (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism).
