He reports feeling cold despite a normal room temperature. His blood glucose has been poorly controlled, and he admits to skipping meals. His current medication regimen includes metformin and a thiazide diuretic.", "options": {"A": "Initiate immediate intravenous dextrose therapy.", "B": "Confirm the diagnosis of hypoglycemia and assess for autonomic neuropathy.", "C": "Increase his dose of sulfonylureas.", "D": "Order a fasting lipid panel."}, "keyed_answer": "B", "explanation": "The clinical picture – confusion, irritability, tremor, cold intolerance, and skipping meals – strongly suggests hypoglycemia, particularly in the presence of autonomic neuropathy (as evidenced by tremor and sweating, though sweating is often absent in later stages). Confirming the diagnosis is crucial, and assessing for autonomic neuropathy helps determine the underlying mechanism and guides treatment. Option A is too aggressive initially; Option C would likely worsen the hypoglycemia. Option D is not directly relevant to the immediate concern."}

{"item_id": "5b23edda7510", "topic": "Female reproductive endocrinology", "question": "A 32-year-old woman with a history of irregular periods and hirsutism is found to have a significantly elevated serum testosterone level. She denies any virilizing symptoms beyond mild hirsutism. Ultrasound of the ovaries is normal. Further investigation is needed to determine the source of the testosterone. What is the most appropriate next step?", "options": {"A": "Measure DHEA-S levels.", "B": "Perform an overnight dexamethasone suppression test.", "C": "Measure SHBG levels.", "D": "Repeat the testosterone measurement with a different laboratory."}, "keyed_answer": "B", "explanation": "In a woman with elevated testosterone and normal ovaries, excluding adrenal androgen production is crucial. The overnight dexamethasone suppression test assesses for ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, which can cause adrenal androgen hypersecretion. DHEA-S would be elevated if adrenal androgen production is the cause, but the dexamethasone test is a more direct assessment of ACTH dependence. SHBG reflects peripheral androgen activity, and repeating the test is less informative initially."}
{"item_id": "145a4b8edc69", "topic": "Male reproductive endocrinology", "question": "A 45-year-old man with a history of cryptorchidism presents for evaluation of infertility. His serum FSH is significantly elevated, and his testosterone is low. Ultrasound reveals bilateral micronodular testicular hyperplasia. What is the most likely underlying etiology?", "options": {"A": "Klinefelter syndrome", "B": "Primary testicular failure due to Sertoli cell-only dysfunction", "C": "Kallmann syndrome", "D": "Aging (androgen decline in the elderly)"}, "keyed_answer": "B", "explanation": "The combination of elevated FSH, low testosterone, cryptorchidism, and micronodular testicular hyperplasia strongly suggests primary testicular failure due to Sertoli cell-only dysfunction. Sertoli cells are responsible for FSH responsiveness and sperm production; their absence leads to elevated FSH and impaired testosterone production despite the gonadotropin stimulation. Micronodular testicular hyperplasia is a characteristic finding in this condition. Klinefelter syndrome typically presents with low testosterone, high FSH, and a 47,XXY karyotype (not mentioned). Kallmann syndrome involves anosmia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Androgen decline in the elderly is a more gradual process."}
